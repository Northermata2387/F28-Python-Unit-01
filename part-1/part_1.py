# Let's assign variables to represent a book you enjoy.

# Step 2 - Strings
# Let's start with Python strings. Replace the "None" with the name of a book, and below the name of the book_author of your book.

book_title = "Nose Dive"
book_author = "Harold McGee"
# book_title = "Dune"
# book_author = "Frank Herbert"

# Step 3 - Concatenation and f-strings
# Use concatenation and f-strings to make a sentence about your book_author and book name.

sentence1 = book_title + " is written by " + book_author + "."
# sentence1 = book_title + " is written by " + book_author + "."
sentence2 = f"The author {book_author}, wrote the book {book_title}."
# sentence2 = f"book_author, {book_author}, wrote the book {book_title}."

# Step 4 - Integers
# Now let's practice Integers. Replace the "None" below with the publication date of your book.
publication_year = 2020
# publication_year = 1965

# Step 5 - Floats
# Now estimate what the retail value of your book would be at a store and replace the "None" below with a float value of the price. (Doesn't have to be accurate.)
book_price = 26.49
# book_price = 17.99

# Step 6 - Booleans
# Now we will practice with booleans. Replace the "is_awesome" variable with a boolean. True if your book is awesome, False if your book is not awesome.
is_awesome = True
# is_awesome = True

# Step 7 - print and type functions
# Follow the instructions, and below this line, code all of the suggested print statements and the type statements.

# CODE PRINT OPTIONS BELOW
print(book_title)
print(book_author)
print(sentence1)
print(sentence2)
print(publication_year)
print(book_price)
print(is_awesome)

# CODE PRINT TYPE OPTIONS BELOW
print(type(book_title))
print(type(book_author))
print(type(sentence1))
print(type(sentence2))
print(type(publication_year))
print(type(book_price))
print(type(is_awesome))
